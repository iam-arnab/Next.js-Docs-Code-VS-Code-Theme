# Next.js Docs Theme

I liked the theme on the Next.js Docs. Saw one theme for it but it wasn't 100% same but I wanted it to be. So far I've made it to be as close as possible. I made it based on [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ShayanAliJalbani.nextjs-theme). Thanks to the author for doing most of the heavylifting!
